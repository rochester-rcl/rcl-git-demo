# RCL Git Demo
This project is a demo of how we're using GitHub at RCL (YMMV!)


## Requirements
- [GitHub](https://desktop.github.com/) The GitHub client will make your life much easier, unless you love CLI.
- Coffee

### Known Issues
- Learning curve for using the tools is minimal; learning curve for using the process is not.

### Other
- We may need some more coffee
